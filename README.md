# Simple Chat

---
This is a warm-up project for **18-652: Foundations of Software Engineering**, a course at CMU Silicon Valley.
It is a simple web-based chat room, backed with express.js.

# Reference

---
1. The chat room borrowed the design from 
[this example on Bootstrap Snippet](https://www.bootdey.com/snippets/view/animated-chat-window).
2. [This guide](https://codeshack.io/basic-login-system-nodejs-express-mysql/) helped me greatly learning Node.js and 
login system.
3. [This tutorial](https://betterprogramming.pub/build-a-chat-app-in-node-js-with-room-functionality-6ebbd4b19133) 
   taught me how to build a real-time chatroom.
